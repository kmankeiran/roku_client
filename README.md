# Roku Client build

After working off of the class files, I have managed to make a Roku Flashback app full of movies, Tv Shows, and Songs. Once you load the file, you will be introduced to a login page. After inputing the proper username, you will have one of 3 profiles to choose.
Once you click on a profile, you will be guided to a homepage containing a wide selection of movies, you can filter through them to preview movies of any particular genre. Once you click a thumbnail, you will have a preview of the trailer from that movie you clicked on and a description of the film.
On the left of the page you will have one of three selections to go to to view a page; you can view only tv shows, music, or movies each with their own genre filter. Must have the roku server running in the background for this to work.
